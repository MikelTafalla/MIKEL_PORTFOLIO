# MIKEL_PORTFOLIO
1. This portfolio is a mobile responsive portfolio.
2. Responsiveness is achieved with the use of Bootstrap.
3. It is formed by three tabs (Home -bio; Portfolio, Contact).

Note: After including the different screen sizes where I needed the portfolio to be responsive, I found out that in order to add margins to the navbar in screens small or bigger, and eliminate the margins on xs screens, I needed to use @media queries. I include just that one (minimal) mediaquery, but I included it as a comment so it doesn't take effect. In case you want to test it you should uncomment it.
